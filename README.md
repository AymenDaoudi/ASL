# ASL
Api Scripting Library, a CLI tool to generate .Net/.Net core web Apis written in C#.

# Description

ASL is under current development, it aims to help generate .net web apis that are written in C# with little efforts.
The generated apis are decoupled and architectured following clean/onion architecutre.
Code generation is ensured using **Roslyn**, by using **CSCG.Roslyn** library that is also under active development.

# Notice 
ASL, CSCG.Roslyn and CSCG.Abstract are all under active development and not stable.
Changes are expected at any time.

CSCG.Roslyn and CSCG.Abstract are available for experimentation on Nuget.
